## What Happens When You Type "https://www.google.com" in Your Browser and Press Enter

### DNS request
    DNS resolution: Your browser looks up the IP address of "google.com" using DNS (Domain Name System), so it knows where to send the request.

### TCP/IP
    Request hits the server IP on the appropriate port: The request is sent to the IP address found, typically on port 80 for non-encrypted or port 443 for encrypted traffic (HTTPS).

### HTTPS/SSL
    Traffic is encrypted: If it's HTTPS, your request is encrypted, ensuring privacy and security.

### Firewall
    Traffic goes through a firewall: The request passes through a firewall that checks for any potential threats or rules.

### Load-balancer
    Request is distributed via a load balancer: The request might be sent to different servers based on a load balancer, which spreads the traffic across multiple servers to prevent overload.

### Web server
    Web server answers the request by serving a web page: The web server takes the request and prepares the necessary response, which is typically the HTML content of a webpage.

### Application server
    Application server generates the web page: The web server may pass the request to an application server, which handles complex logic and generates the actual content.

### Database
    Application server requests data from the database: If needed, the application server will ask the database for information (search results) to include in the web page.

After all these steps, your browser receives the final web page and displays it for you.
